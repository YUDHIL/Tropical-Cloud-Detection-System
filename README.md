# Tropical Cloud Detection System using Satellite Half-hourly Data

## Overview
The *Tropical Cloud Detection System* is a web-based application designed to monitor and visualize tropical cloud clusters using satellite half-hourly data from the INSAT series of satellites.  
This project aims to provide real-time insights into tropical weather systems by combining meteorological satellite imagery and AI-driven prediction techniques.
