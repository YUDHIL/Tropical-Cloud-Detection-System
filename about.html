    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>Tropical Cloud Detection System using Satellite Half-hourly Data</b> is a research-oriented web project designed
      to detect, analyze, and visualize tropical cloud formations using frequent satellite observations. The project aims
      to support weather research and climate analysis by providing clear visual data of cloud behavior across tropical regions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system focuses on processing half-hourly satellite imagery — this allows the detection of fast-changing
      cloud clusters and atmospheric patterns. By visualizing these transitions, meteorologists can monitor the
      evolution of storms, cloud thickness, and possible cyclone formations in real-time.
    </p>

    <p>
      In its next version, this project will integrate <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Deep Learning</b> models to automatically
      classify cloud types and forecast severe weather events. Frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch will be utilized to
      train CNN models on satellite datasets for automated tropical cloud prediction.
    </p>

    <p>
      The website is designed using <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>, built with a professional dark theme and modern interface.
      It ensures smooth navigation, clear data representation, and a visually appealing dashboard that can be used
      for educational demonstrations, research, or meteorological studies.
