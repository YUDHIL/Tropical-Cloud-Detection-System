    <h2>INSAT Satellite Data Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The data used in this project comes from the <b>Indian National Satellite System (INSAT)</b>, a multipurpose satellite
      system developed and operated by the <b>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</b>. The INSAT series has been a 
      cornerstone of India's meteorological services since the early 1980s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest missions, <b>INSAT-3D</b> and <b>INSAT-3DR</b>, are equipped with advanced imaging and atmospheric sounding
      instruments that provide high-resolution cloud imagery and temperature profiles. These satellites capture 
      multi-spectral images every 30 minutes, enabling detailed observation of tropical weather systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each image contains vital information about cloud structure, density, and movement. These observations are essential 
      for detecting early signs of tropical convection, which can lead to the formation of thunderstorms or cyclones.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Collection and Processing</h2>
    <p>
      The raw satellite data is obtained through <b>Meteorological and Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre (MOSDAC)</b>,
      maintained by ISRO. This data is available in formats such as <b>HDF5</b> and <b>NetCDF</b>, containing multiple channels 
      including visible, shortwave infrared, thermal infrared, and water vapour bands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project preprocesses this raw data using <b>Python-based image processing scripts</b>. These scripts extract 
      essential parameters like brightness temperature, cloud top height, and cloud density. The processed outputs 
      are converted into <b>GeoTIFF</b> or <b>PNG</b> images for visualization in this dashboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process ensures that only relevant and high-quality data is used for machine learning models and visualization.
      By updating every 30 minutes, the system can track evolving weather patterns with near real-time accuracy.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Characteristics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Source:</b> INSAT-3D / INSAT-3DR Satellites by ISRO</li>
      <li><b>Resolution:</b> Spatial - 1km to 4km | Temporal - Every 30 minutes</li>
      <li><b>Coverage:</b> Indian subcontinent and tropical oceanic regions</li>
      <li><b>Format:</b> HDF5 / GeoTIFF / PNG for visualization</li>
      <li><b>Channels:</b> Visible, Shortwave Infrared, Thermal Infrared, Water Vapour</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These datasets are crucial for identifying tropical cloud clusters, especially those showing rapid vertical growth,
      which indicates the early stages of strong convection. Such information helps in predicting storm intensification 
      and heavy rainfall events.
    </p>

    <h2>Importance of INSAT Data in Tropical Cloud Detection</h2>
    <p>
      Tropical cloud clusters form due to intense heating in the equatorial regions. INSAT’s frequent observations help 
      scientists monitor the lifecycle of these clouds, from their initial buildup to dissipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The high temporal resolution (30-minute interval) enables tracking of cloud motion and temperature changes, 
      allowing early warning of potential tropical storms. Combined with AI algorithms, such data can greatly enhance 
      disaster preparedness and weather forecasting accuracy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Integration with AI Models</h2>
    <p>
      This project aims to integrate INSAT data with machine learning models such as <b>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</b>
      to automatically detect and classify tropical cloud clusters. The models analyze image textures and temperature variations
      to identify high-risk zones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The backend processing (Flask + ML model) generates predictions that are displayed on the dashboard in real-time. 
      Users can visualize predicted cloud clusters, rainfall zones, and other meteorological indicators directly from the 
      homepage.
